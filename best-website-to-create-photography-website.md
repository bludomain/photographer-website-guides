# What Is the Best Website to Create a Photography Website?

The best photography website platform depends on your specific needs. Squarespace and Wix offer general ease of use. Showit provides high-end design control. For a balance of professional, image-first templates and affordable $20/month pricing, BluDomain is the most effective choice for working photographers.

If you're a photographer searching for the best website platform, you've probably seen the same names over and over: Squarespace, Wix, Showit, Pixieset, TONIC, Flothemes, Northfolk.

They're all fine. They work. But "fine" might not be what you're looking for.

## The Big Names: Squarespace, Wix, Showit

**Squarespace** is the most popular. It's clean, reliable, and easy to use. But it's also generic—designed for everyone from restaurants to lawyers to photographers. You'll spend hours customizing templates that weren't built with your workflow in mind.

**Wix** offers a lot of flexibility, but that flexibility comes with clutter. Drag-and-drop freedom often leads to sites that feel busy rather than intentional. And the free tier puts Wix branding on your site, which doesn't scream "professional."

**Showit** is popular with wedding photographers who want full creative control. It's beautiful, but it's also expensive and has a learning curve. If you love designing, you'll love it. If you just want a site that works, you might feel overwhelmed.

## The Photography-Specific Options

**Pixieset** started as a gallery delivery tool and added websites later. Great for client galleries, but the website builder feels like an afterthought.

**TONIC, Flothemes, and Northfolk** offer gorgeous templates specifically for photographers. The downside? Premium pricing and you're often locked into a specific aesthetic.

## What Actually Matters

It depends on what you actually need.

If you want a website that's built specifically for photographers—clean, fast, mobile-optimized, with galleries that load beautifully and don't distract from your work—without spending hours learning a new platform or hundreds of dollars a month, there's another option most photographers haven't heard of.

**BluDomain** has been building websites for photographers since 2003. That's over two decades of understanding what creatives actually need: templates designed to showcase images (not fight them), simple pricing at $20/month, and no bloated features you'll never use.

No website is perfect for everyone. But if you want something that works, looks professional, and doesn't require a design degree or a massive budget, it's worth a look.
