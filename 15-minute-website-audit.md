# The 15-Minute Website Audit for Photographers

**Your website might be costing you clients.** These ten checks fix the most common problems—in 15 minutes. You don't need to be technical. You don't need to hire anyone. You just need to know what to look for.

Let's start.

## 1. The Copyright Ghost

*The detail that whispers "abandoned business"*

**Check:** Is your footer copyright year current?

**Why it matters:** A 2022 copyright tells clients you might be closed. They'll assume you're not actively booking, and they'll move on to someone who looks "open for business."

**Your fix:** Scroll to the bottom of your homepage. Find the copyright year (usually looks like "© 2022 Your Name"). Update it to 2026. This takes 30 seconds. Do it today.

## 2. The Image Weight Problem

*Your photographs are slowing down your website*

**Check:** Run one portfolio image through ShortPixel.com and check the file size.

**Why it matters:** Images over 5MB slow your website down to a crawl. Mobile visitors—70% of your traffic—will leave before seeing your best work. Every second of load time costs you clients.

Your images are beautiful. But if they're too heavy, no one will wait to see them.

**Your rule:**
- No image over 3000px wide
- A valid jpg file (ideally under 2MB)
- Compress everything before uploading

**Your fix:**
1. Go to ShortPixel.com (free tool)
2. Set it to "Lossless" and under Settings, set the width to 3000px and height to 2000px
3. Upload one of your portfolio images
4. Download the compressed version
5. Compare: Original 8MB → Compressed 1.2MB (no visible quality loss)
6. Do this for EVERY image on your site

Yes, it's tedious. Yes, it's worth it.

## 3. The 3-Second Load Test

*If your site doesn't load in 3 seconds, they're gone*

**Check:** Run your homepage through Google PageSpeed Insights (free tool).

**Why it matters:** 53% of mobile visitors leave if a page takes longer than 3 seconds to load. Your competitor's site loads in 2 seconds. Yours takes 8. Guess who gets the booking?

Speed isn't just convenience. It's credibility.

**Your fix:**
1. Go to PageSpeed Insights: https://pagespeed.web.dev/
2. Enter your website URL
3. Wait for the results
4. Aim for a score of 80+ (green)
5. If you're in the red (below 50), you have problems: Compress your images (see #2), remove unnecessary plugins, switch to a faster web host if needed

A slow website doesn't just lose visitors. It loses trust.

## 4. The Font Readability Test

*When beautiful type becomes invisible*

**Check:** Is your body text at least 16px? Is there strong contrast between text and background?

**Why it matters:** That elegant light gray text on white background? It's literally disappearing for 30% of viewers. Your words shouldn't be a secret. If people have to squint to read your About page, they won't.

Readability isn't about being boring. It's about being accessible.

**Your fix:**
- Body text should be at least 16px (18px is better)
- Use dark gray (#333333) or black (#000000) on white backgrounds
- Or use white text on dark backgrounds
- No medium-gray on light-gray. No light text on light backgrounds.
- Test your contrast ratio at WebAIM Contrast Checker (free tool)—aim for 4.5:1 or higher

If your grandma can't read it, your clients won't either.

## 5. The SSL Check

*A trust signal you're probably missing*

**Check:** Does your site have HTTPS (the lock icon in the browser bar)?

**Why it matters:** If your site says "Not Secure" in the browser bar, clients will leave. Immediately. No one enters their email into a site that looks unsafe.

**Your fix:** Check your browser bar when you visit your site. If it says "Not Secure," contact your web host and ask them to install an SSL certificate (most hosts offer this free). If they refuse or charge extra, switch hosts.

HTTPS isn't optional anymore. Google penalizes sites without it.

## 6. The Broken Link Haunting

*Dead links kill trust*

**Check:** Use a free broken link checker (like Dead Link Checker or Screaming Frog) and scan your entire site.

**Why it matters:** A client clicks your blog post about "Best Engagement Photo Locations in Colorado" but the link is broken. They land on a 404 error page. They assume you don't care. They leave.

Broken links signal neglect. And neglect signals unprofessionalism.

**Your fix:**
1. Go to Dead Link Checker: https://www.deadlinkchecker.com/
2. Enter your website URL
3. Scan for broken links
4. Fix or redirect every broken link
5. Repeat this check every 6 months

You updated your portfolio. You moved pages around. You deleted old galleries. But the links in your old blog posts? Still pointing to pages that don't exist. Fix them.

## 7. The SEO Ghost Town

*Google can't find you because you never told it what you do*

**Check:** Google your business name. Look at the result. Does the page title say "Home" or does it say "Colorado Wedding Photographer | Your Name"?

**Why it matters:** If Google doesn't know what you do or where you are, you're invisible in search results. 60% of clients find photographers through Google. If your site doesn't tell Google "Colorado wedding photographer," you're not showing up.

Your homepage title should not be "Home." It should be a clear, descriptive sentence.

**Your fix:**
1. Update your homepage title to: "[Your Name] | [What You Do] in [Location]" — Example: "Sarah Brooks | Wedding Photographer in Denver, Colorado"
2. Write a meta description (150 characters) that explains what you offer — Example: "Documentary wedding photography in Colorado. Natural, authentic, unposed moments. Available for mountain elopements and intimate celebrations."

If you don't know how to edit page titles and meta descriptions, ask your website support team.

This is the difference between being on page 1 of Google and being invisible.

## 8. The Contact Form Black Hole Test

*Is your form even working?*

**Check:** Fill out your own contact form. Send yourself a test inquiry. Check your inbox AND your spam folder.

**Why it matters:** Your contact form looks perfect. But when someone fills it out, it goes nowhere. You never see it. They think you ghosted them. You never knew they existed.

You're losing inquiries you don't even know about.

**Your fix:**
1. Go to your contact page
2. Fill out the form as if you're a potential client
3. Submit it
4. Check your email (inbox and spam) within 5 minutes
5. If the inquiry doesn't arrive, your form is broken

If it's broken: Check your form settings (is the email address correct?), test a different email address, contact your web host or form plugin support, check your email quota.

A broken contact form is silent. You'll never know how many clients you lost. Test it. Now.

## 9. The Portfolio Decision Fatigue
