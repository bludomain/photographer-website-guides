# What Every Wedding Photographer Website Needs in 2026

**Your site is your handshake.** If your wedding photography portfolio isn't converting visitors into inquiries, you likely have a "scrolling" problem, not a "talent" problem. In 2026, your website has one job: get to yes. Most couples are viewing your work on a phone between errands—they aren't reading, they are feeling. Every section must earn its place.

No one's reading paragraphs. They're scrolling. Probably on their phone. So every single section on your website needs to be intentional.

Here's my blueprint:

---

## Show Your Range. Horizontally.

Top 10 images. All horizontal. No mixing in vertical shots, it breaks the flow. Show your visitors your favorite 10 images that give a true representation of what they will receive.

---

## Curate, Don't Dump.

Galleries are for the convinced, not the curious. 30 images per wedding, max. Intentional. Powerful. This isn't a proofing gallery; it's the section where you curate weddings. What can the wedding couple expect.

---

## Here's Who I Am. (Keep it Human.)

Two short paragraphs. That's it. Be credible, be you. Then show a real, professional photo of your face. If you invest in presenting your own business well, I'll trust you to invest in my wedding.

---

## Here's Who Used Me. (The Right Way.)

Testimonials that speak to values, not just "great photos!" Does this couple's experience sound like what I want? If their words resonate, I'm already sold.

---

## Here's More to Say "Yes." (No Games.)

Pricing. Show a range, at the very least. Stop hiding it. You're not protecting yourself; you're wasting everyone's time. Your future client already knows their budget.

---

## Nudge Them to Stay.

An email opt-in. Give them something genuinely helpful for planning. Then stay in their inbox, kindly.

---

## And Your Tech? Non-Negotiable.

Custom domain. Mobile-first design. Blazing fast. If your site lags on my phone, I'm already gone.

Your site is your handshake.
